	DESCRIPTION:
		In Adobe Coldfusion 8, AJAX support was added. As part of that, a JavaScript function ColdFusion.navigate() was added.
		While it is not recommended to use this in greenfield development, it is important to be aware of how this works for when it is encountered supporting legacy code.

	REQUIREMENTS:
		<cfajaximport>

	USAGE:
		ColdFusion.navigate( URL [, container, callbackhandler, errorhandler, httpMethod, formId] );

	EXAMPLE:
--->
<cfparam name="url.action" default="">

<html>
	<head>
		<!--- includes JavaScript ColdFusion object --->
		<cfajaximport>

		<script>
			function click( go ) {
				/* Makes AJAX call to URL in go and updates content in #container with returned content */
				ColdFusion.navigate( go, "container" );
			}
		</script>
	</head>

	<body>
		<!--- returns content for ColdFusion.navigate() AJAX call --->
		<cfif action is "click">
			Clicked!

		<!--- otherwise we display the main content --->
		<cfelse>
			<!--- this is the container whose content will be replaced when ColdFusion.navigate() is called --->
			<span id="container">
				<!--- action helps us to identify whether to display full page's content or just what is returned to ColdFusion.navigate() AJAX call. We could just as easily specified an entirely different URL. --->
				<cfoutput><a href="javascript:click( '#cgi.HTTP_URL#?action=click' );">Click me</a></cfoutput>
			</span>
		</cfif>
	</body>
</html>
